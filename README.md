# vf-apps
Overview repo for other repos for apps based on the VF model and vocabulary.

The [Open Cooperative Ecosystem](https://docs.opencoopecosystem.net/) intends to create flocks of modular apps that will all work together using the VF vocabulary and a decentralized protocol such as [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/), or [Holochain](https://holochain.org/).

We would like the apps to be able to work on any of those three protocols and many others to come. 

Some work is already underway in each of those protocols. The one that is closest to deployment is [Moinho-Mesh](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25d2dJqZwk52zSV3z9oB5MlisgUlQGK8tFXEOn6fKf8sY%3D.sha256) in Moinho, Brazil. Their repos are currently in [the Open App Ecosystem github group](https://github.com/open-app). They first announced in the [Open App Ecosystem Loomio group](https://www.loomio.org/d/KEcf2u84/experimentation-with-open-app-ecosystem).

@bhaugen and @fosterlynn will be writing specs for a suite of apps for federated economic networks in the days to come, in separate repos in the [valueflows organization](https://github.com/valueflows). We will add links for each of those repos to this overview readme as they are published.

We will mine existing apps using VF-compatible models for ideas and logic. Those include:
* the [Vocabulator](https://github.com/valueflows/django-vocabulator)
* [Resourceful](https://github.com/valueflows/resourceful)
* [linked-data-browser](https://github.com/valueflows/linked-data-browser)
* [Holodex](https://github.com/holodex/holodex)
* The original [NRP](https://github.com/valnet/valuenetwork) developed with Sensorica.
* [OCP](https://github.com/FreedomCoop/valuenetwork) fork of NRP for FairCoop
* [Agent](https://github.com/opencooperativeecosystem/agent), first app that is truly part of OCE
* [OCE repos](https://github.com/opencooperativeecosystem)
* [LearnDeep](https://github.com/LearnDeepMilwaukee) fork of NRP + Agent
* [Sensorica's new fork of NRP for Verdun](https://github.com/Sensorica/VerdunNRP)

## The Apps

By some persuasive demand, the first app will not be an app, but an algorithm that can be made into a module potentially usable by many apps: 
* **[Traversing the value flows](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-apps-traversing-the-flows).**
